## TODO list

- try some "maybe real" interference graphs (eg. generate cliques)
- try to feed the neighbours directly
- graph partitioning theorem (future work)
- try data augmentation (e.g. node permutations)
- for size(graph) < 100, try to feed the graph to all nodes, not just to some of them (try node permutations)
- try one LSTM instead of 100 in order to learn constraints (done)
